Installation and Setup
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Git

Frontend Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-furniture-store.git
cd online-furniture-store/frontend # Or wherever your frontend code resides

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add your environment variables (e.g., API endpoint):

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# Add other frontend specific variables here

Start the development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start

The frontend application will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Backend Setup (Example for Node.js/Express)
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd ../backend # Assuming backend is in a sibling directory

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Create a .env file in the backend directory and configure your database and other settings:

PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/furniture_store
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
# Add other backend specific variables here (e.g., API keys for payment gateways)

Make sure to replace your_jwt_secret_key with a strong, random string.

Run database migrations/seed data (if applicable):

# Example for a SQL database
npm run migrate
npm run seed

Start the backend server:

npm start
# or
node server.js # Or whatever your main entry file is

The backend API will typically run on http://localhost:5000.
